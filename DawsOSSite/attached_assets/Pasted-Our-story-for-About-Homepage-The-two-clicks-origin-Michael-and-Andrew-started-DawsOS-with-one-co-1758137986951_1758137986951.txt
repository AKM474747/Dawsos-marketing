Our story (for About / Homepage)
The two-clicks origin
Michael and Andrew started DawsOS with one constraint: no number anywhere in the UI unless you can reach its evidence in two clicks. Black-box “risk scores” weren’t cutting it for boards, auditors, or regulators. So they built a Propagation OS—a system that explains how shocks travel through companies, portfolios, and policies, with probabilities that are calibrated and reproducible.
They wrote an operating constitution, not just code: governed schemas, versioned events, typed temporal edges, patterns that create virtual edges (never altering facts), and snapshots that let you replay any decision state exactly. The result: every prediction returns a causal path, its provenance, a calibrated probability, and a snapshot ID you can replay on demand. (“Two clicks to evidence” isn’t a tagline; it’s an interface contract.)
What makes our method different
Causality before prediction: the chain comes first; the number comes second.
Calibration before output: probabilities must meet strict error targets or degrade conservatively.
Provenance by default: every fact, version, and time window is traceable.
Reproducibility: any result can be replayed from its snapshot.
Governed change: schemas evolve via proposals, migrations, and review—not vibes.
SLOs as product: latency, accuracy, reliability aren’t back-office charts; they’re UI promises.
That’s how DawsOS shipped from idea → architecture → operating model, and why teams trust it when decisions (and audits) are on the line.
How we built it (The Method)
Phase 0 — Frame the shocks
Define the domains, events, and outcomes that matter. Name the predicates (typed relationships), the lags, and validity windows.
Phase 1 — Govern the facts
Event taxonomy (versioned topics), canonical envelope (event_id, ts, version, producer), ingest → validate → quarantine → entity resolution.
Phase 2 — Graph & patterns
Typed, temporal edges; patterns produce virtual edges only. Traversal explains why and how fast propagation happens.
Phase 3 — Reasoning & calibration
Calibrate probabilities to target error (ECE/Brier) before you render any output.
Phase 4 — Snapshots & replay
Every prediction binds to a snapshot—so “Reproduce with snapshot” is one click anywhere results appear.
Phase 5 — SLOs made visible
Performance and reliability become UI badges (p95 traversal, alert E2E, calibration state). If it matters, it’s in the interface.
The retail layer (without confusing the enterprise product)
We productized the way we built DawsOS into a simple “Build like DawsOS” track for creators, consultants, and startup teams:
The Idea → Code Kit (ZIP)
What’s inside
System prompts & persona scripts for “operating-constitution” work.
Templates: event taxonomy, schema change playbook, predicate catalog, pattern lifecycle gates.
Blueprints: agent-first workflow scaffolds, pricing/packaging matrices, SLO badge patterns.
n8n automations: sale→fulfillment, KPI watchdog (RPS_net vs CPC), affiliate engine, content factory, release pipeline.
A 72-hour Quickstart: from blank page to architecture draft and agent workflows.
Outcomes
Draft a coherent business + software architecture in a weekend.
Generate governed templates you can hand to engineers, ops, and counsel.
Move from “prompting” to operating.
Agent Workbench (light subscription)
A growing template library + exporters. One click turns your artifacts into runnable n8n flows, GPT profiles, and starter repos.
Important: The Kit and Workbench are methods, not the DawsOS platform. They’re a separate “Retail Kit” path (clearly labeled) that teaches you to build with our operating model.

What’s inside (tile copy)
Operating constitution templates — product, governance, security, change control.
Event taxonomy & predicate catalogs — versioned topics, typed edges, lags, validity windows.
Agent workflows (n8n) — sale→fulfillment, KPI watchdog, content factory, affiliate engine, release pipeline.
SLO in the UI — badges, thresholds, and runbooks baked into components.
72-hour Quickstart — a checklist to ship a real draft by Monday.
Why it’s different
Most “prompt packs” sell tricks. This is a governed operating model that ships evidence, calibration, and replay into your product from day one.
Pricing (example layout)
Starter — $49
Prompts + core templates + Quickstart + 1 agent (fulfillment).
Pro — $199
Starter + videos + 6-month updates + Discord + all n8n agents + “how to sell” scripts.
Bundle — Pro + 3 months Workbench
Build, export, and run your flows.
Guarantee
If you don’t generate a complete draft in 72 hours, we’ll refund you—no questions asked.
FAQ (snippets)
Is this DawsOS? No. This is the method we used to build it.
Can I use the templates commercially? Yes—resale of the Kit itself is not permitted.
Does it require code? Only for the optional n8n workflows; everything else is docs and structure.
Founders sidebar (About page)
Michael — product + governance. Turned “two clicks to evidence” into product rules: source before chart, calibration with every number, replay anywhere results appear.
Andrew — growth + automation. Operationalized the method: event taxonomies, meters, SLO monitors, and an automation layer so the business runs itself.
Together, they made two innovations:
The technology (causal graph reasoning with calibration and provenance).
The operating model (governed change, reproducible evidence, SLOs in the UI).

Hook (0–5s): “We built an OS for tracing how shocks spread. Here’s the method we used.”
Problem (5–15s): “Most teams start with prompts and end up with guesswork.”
Method (15–40s): “We start with events, predicates, lags → governed schemas → patterns make virtual edges → probabilities are calibrated before output → snapshots make every result replayable.”

Where the n8n agents fit on the Methods site
Each agent has its own mini page (or accordion card) with:
What it does → Why it matters → How to import (.json) → MS Graph scopes → Test steps
Link those pages from the Kit “What’s inside” section and from your Methods Coach GPT so buyers can self-serve setup.
Final positioning line (use everywhere on retail pages)
“Build like DawsOS: governed templates, agent workflows, and a 72-hour path from idea to architecture.”
If you want, I can turn this into a pair of ready-to-ship pages (Homepage section + full Methods landing) with exact HTML copy blocks and the n8n agent cards formatted for your site’s component library.
