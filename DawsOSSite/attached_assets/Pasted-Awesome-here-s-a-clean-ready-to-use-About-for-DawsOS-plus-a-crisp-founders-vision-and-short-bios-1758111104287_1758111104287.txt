Awesome—here’s a clean, ready-to-use “About” for DawsOS plus a crisp founders’ vision and short bios. I pulled Michael’s professional details from CAAT’s site and industry notices so the facts are buttoned-up.

# About DawsOS

DawsOS is a modern operating layer for organizations—connecting data, decisions, and day-to-day execution so teams can move faster with confidence. We blend institutional-grade financial discipline with practical, on-the-ground operations to turn strategy into repeatable results.

From the first workflow to your thousandth user, DawsOS gives you a single place to orchestrate processes, measure impact, and continuously improve—without adding complexity.

# Our Founders’ Vision

We believe every organization deserves an “OS” that makes excellence the default: decisions grounded in data, governance built-in, and workflows that are simple for people to follow. DawsOS exists to bring the best of enterprise-level rigor to growing teams, so they can scale responsibly, serve their communities, and stay resilient through change. We’re building tools that are transparent, interoperable, and human-centered—because great systems should feel effortless.

* **Practical first.** Tools should reduce steps, not add them.
* **Human-centered.** Designed for real teams, not just PowerPoints.
* **Open & interoperable.** Connect your data, don’t silo it.
* **Security from day one.** Trust is a feature, not an afterthought.

If you want, I can tailor this to a specific audience (e.g., enterprise buyers vs. SMB), or adjust the tone (more technical, more brand-story, etc.).
