Perfect — thanks for sharing the screenshot. I see the design uses your **evidence-coded palette** (teal/blue/purple/amber/red), the “two clicks to evidence” principle, and a clean marketing layout.

Here’s how you can structure a **“How It Works” product story on your corporate site**, building on this design:

---

# 🔎 Narrative Flow for Website UI

### 1. Start with the Hook (Hero Section)

* **Headline (already good):** “Shows how shocks travel through markets.”

* **Refinement for real estate/business visitors:**

  * Option A: “See how shocks ripple through your portfolio.”
  * Option B: “From rate hikes to rent defaults — trace every causal link.”

* **Supporting subline:**

  * “Who’s next, how fast, how sure — always with evidence you can defend.”

* **Interactive causal path widget** (already in place):

  * Step through *Event → Chain → Impact*.
  * Highlight calibration (e.g., “Confidence: 0.87 ± 0.03”).
  * CTA: “View Evidence (2 clicks).”

---

### 2. How It Works (3-step flow)

Keep it simple, aligned to **business user language**:

1. **Start with any signal**

   * “A rate hike, a zoning policy, or a supply chain delay.”
   * (Icon: ⚡ Signal).

2. **Get the ripple map**

   * “See who’s impacted next, with timing and confidence.”
   * (Icon: 🌊 Ripple).

3. **Act with evidence**

   * “Every forecast comes with its causal path and provenance. Replay any analysis.”
   * (Icon: ✅ Evidence).

---

### 3. Value Proposition Tiles (below the fold)

3–4 short, dense cards:

* **Two clicks to evidence** → “Every claim is linked to its source.”
* **Calibrated confidence** → “Probabilities meet strict error guarantees.”
* **Replayable snapshots** → “Reproduce any analysis, anytime.”
* **Governed by design** → “Immutable rules enforce explainability and compliance.”

---

### 4. Sector-specific Callouts

For Real Estate/Finance:

* “Understand how rate hikes flow into mortgage resets, arrears, and litigation.”
* “Scenario Builder helps test rent control or zoning policy changes — instantly.”

---

### 5. Conversion / CTA

* **Primary CTA:** “Book a Demo.”
* **Secondary CTA:** “See How It Works.”
* Both are already in your design — good placement.

# 🖥️ Suggestions for UI polish

* Make the **Interactive Causal Path** box clickable with hover animations (edge highlights, confidence bars).
* Add **microcopy tags** under the widget (e.g., *“Calibration: within SLO”*, *“Replay with snapshot”*).
* Use **dotted edges** in the widget to indicate *pattern-derived* (virtual) links vs. solid edges for facts — matches your brand north star rules.

⚡ This way, the website shows **what the system does** (shocks → paths → evidence), **how it works** (3 steps), and **why it matters** (business-grade, auditable, compliant).

Would you like me to **mock up a “Real Estate” version of this website UI** (same style, but with sector-specific examples like *Rate hike → Mortgage resets → Tenant arrears → Legal exposure*)? That could help you pitch to property management executives more directly.
