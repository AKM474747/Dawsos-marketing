## Governance Principles

1. **Consistency** - All patterns must be followed consistently across the application
2. **Maintainability** - Code should be easy to understand, modify, and extend
3. **Security** - Security must be built into every pattern and practice
4. **Accessibility** - All UI must be accessible by default
5. **Performance** - Optimize for user experience and loading times
6. **Developer Experience** - Patterns should make development faster and more reliable

## Enforcement

These governance documents are not suggestions - they are requirements that must be followed for all new code and should be applied retroactively to existing code during maintenance cycles.

All pull requests must adhere to these standards before merging.
